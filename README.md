# ARR
A RSS-Reader with GUI. Tested to work with Debian Bullseye.

# Installing
debian-packages required: python3-tk python3-venv

```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo apt install python3-tk python3-venv
```

Then clone this repo and run make.
Git will create directory named ARR under the current working directory.
Install-script will create launcher-script named rss to home/bin-directory.
 
```console
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/SamuelKos/ARR
foo@bar:~$ cd ARR
foo@bar:~/ARR$ ./make
```

# About Python dependencies:
Only one library outside standard is used: [html2text](https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text/)
which is installed with pip. Interesting fact is that it is forked from repo
owned by [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz),
who was involved in RSS-format developing and more. Check it out!
 

# Running 

```console
foo@bar:~$ rss
```

# Uninstalling
Just remove the ARR -folder and rss-script in home/bin.
To remove git and tkinter:

```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo apt remove python3-tk git
```
